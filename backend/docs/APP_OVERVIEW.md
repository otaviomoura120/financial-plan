# Financial Plan — App Overview

## Purpose & Vision

**Financial Plan** is a personal and family financial control platform. Its goal is to give users full visibility and control over their financial life: tracking every income and expense, managing bank accounts, organizing spending by category, and generating reports to understand where money is going.

This is the **first module** of a broader platform. The current scope covers:
- Bank account management (balance tracking)
- Income and expense recording (transactions)
- Category and subcategory organization
- Payment method tracking (cash, card, pix, etc.)
- Financial reports with filters and totals

Future modules planned: debts, credit/debit cards, bills, recurring payments, budgets, and investments. The architecture is explicitly designed to accommodate new modules without restructuring existing ones.

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `domain/` | Pure business models (POJOs), repository interfaces (contracts), enums, exceptions |
| `application/` | Use cases — one service class per operation; DTOs as Java records |
| `infrastructure/` | REST controllers, JPA entities, repository implementations, security config |

**Stack:** Java + Spring Boot 4.0.6 · Spring Data JPA · MySQL 8 · Auth0 (authentication) · Gradle · Groovy/Spock (tests)

**Key design decisions:**
- Domain models have zero JPA/Spring annotations; they are pure POJOs with a `validate()` method and business methods
- JPA entities (`*EntityJpa`) live only in infrastructure and are mapped to/from domain models inside `*RepositoryImpl`
- All entities use version-based **optimistic locking** — `setVersion()` throws `ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException` on mismatch
- DTOs are always Java `record` types
- Exception mapping: `DomainException` → 422, `ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException` → 423, generic → 500

## Core Concepts

### Space
A **Space** is a collaborative financial workspace — think "Family Budget" or "Personal Finances". All financial data (bank accounts, categories, transactions) is scoped to a space. A user can belong to multiple spaces.

### User
Authenticated via **Auth0**. The `auth0Sub` field links the app user to the Auth0 identity. One user can be a member of multiple spaces with different roles in each.

### SpaceMember + Role
Every user in a space has a **Role** (e.g., `OWNER`, `VIEWER`). The `OWNER` role is special and protected. Roles control which API endpoints a user can call, evaluated dynamically via `EndpointPermission` records.

### BankAccount
Represents a real financial account (bank, digital wallet, etc.). Tracks a running `balance`. Supports `credit(amount)` and `debit(amount)` operations. Scoped to a Space.

### Category + SubCategory
Two-level classification hierarchy for transactions. Example: Category = "Food", SubCategory = "Groceries". Both are scoped to a Space and can be deactivated (soft delete).

### PaymentMethod
Defines how a transaction was paid — cash, credit card, debit card, pix, check, etc. Scoped to a Space.

### Transaction
The **central entity** of the system. Represents a single financial event:
- `type`: `INCOME`, `EXPENSE` or `TRANSFER`
- `amount`: positive `BigDecimal`
- `transactionDate`: `LocalDate` of when it happened
- Links: `userId`, `bankAccountId`, `destinationBankAccountId`, `categoryId`, `subCategoryId`, `paymentMethodId`
- `description`: optional notes

For `INCOME`/`EXPENSE`, `categoryId` and `paymentMethodId` are required and `destinationBankAccountId` must be null. For `TRANSFER`, `destinationBankAccountId` is required and must differ from `bankAccountId`; `categoryId`/`paymentMethodId` are not required. `TRANSFER` moves money between two bank accounts within the same space and is excluded from `totalIncome`/`totalExpense`/`balance` in Reports (see below), though it still appears in the transaction list.

### EndpointPermission & RoleEndpointPermission
`EndpointPermission` defines one access rule for an HTTP endpoint or a frontend page:
- `endpoint`: Java regex matched against the request URI
- `permittedMethods`: comma-separated HTTP methods (`GET,POST,PUT`)
- `type`: `API` (backend route) or `FRONT_PAGE` (frontend route)
- `group`: optional grouping; `INTERNAL_MANAGEMENT` restricts to master admins

`RoleEndpointPermission` is a join entity linking a `Role` to an `EndpointPermission` with an `ALLOW` or `DENY` decision. On every protected request, `SecurityService` resolves the user's role in the **active space** (identified by the `X-Space-Id` request header) and checks whether that role has an `ALLOW` entry for the matching rule.

### GroupMenu / GroupMenuChildren
Hierarchical UI navigation menu. The menu structure is served to the frontend filtered by the authenticated user's permissions, so each user sees only the sections they can access.

## Key Flows

### 1. User Onboarding
```
POST /users          → create User (linked to Auth0 sub)
POST /spaces         → create Space → auto-creates OWNER role → adds creator as SpaceMember(OWNER)
POST /bank-accounts  → add bank account to the space
POST /categories     → add categories (and subcategories)
POST /payment-methods → add payment methods
```

### 2. Recording a Transaction
```
POST /transactions
  body: { type, userId, bankAccountId, categoryId, subCategoryId, paymentMethodId, amount, transactionDate, description }
  → Transaction.validate() checks all IDs present and amount > 0
  → stored and returned as TransactionResponse
```

### 3. Financial Report
```
POST /reports
  body: { from, to, userId?, bankAccountId?, categoryId?, subCategoryId?, paymentMethodId?, type? }
  → queries transactions matching all filters
  → returns: { transactions[], totalIncome, totalExpense, balance }
```

### 4. Access Control Flow
```
Incoming request  (must carry Authorization: Bearer <token> and X-Space-Id: <spaceId>)
  → Spring Security extracts Auth0 JWT  →  401 if invalid
  → @PreAuthorize calls SecurityService
      → userHasPermissionForURL  (reads X-Space-Id header)
          → resolves SpaceMember for (spaceId, userId)
          → checks RoleEndpointPermission ALLOW for that role + matching endpoint regex
      OR
      → userHasPermissionInSpace  (space from URL path variable)
      OR
      → userHasPermissionForRole  (space derived from role ID)
  → allowed or 403
```

### 5. Managing Roles & Permissions
```
POST /roles           → create role in a space
PUT  /roles/{id}/assign-user/{userId}?spaceId=  → change member's role
POST /endpoint-permissions  → define which roles can access which endpoints
```

## Adding a New Module

Follow this checklist when extending the platform with a new financial module (e.g., debts, recurring bills):

1. **Domain** — add new model class in `domain/` (POJO, `validate()`, business methods). Add repository interface in `domain/repository/`.
2. **Application** — create a package under `application/<module>/` with service classes (one per use case) and record DTOs.
3. **Infrastructure** — add JPA entity in `infrastructure/repository/jpa/`, repository implementation in `infrastructure/repository/`, and REST controller in `infrastructure/controller/`.
4. **Permissions** — seed `EndpointPermission` records for the new endpoints.
5. **Menu** — optionally add `GroupMenu` / `GroupMenuChildren` entries for UI navigation.
6. **Tests** — write Groovy/Spock unit tests for all new services. Run `./gradlew test` and the ArchUnit suite (`ArchitectureTest`) to confirm no layer rules were broken.

Spaces already provide the multi-tenancy boundary — new entities should reference a `Space` to keep data isolated per group.
